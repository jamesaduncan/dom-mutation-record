# dom-mutation-record
DOM Mutation Records that can be serialized to HTML and then applied to documents.

This has been derived almost entirely from Meeshkan's [mutation-observer-applier](https://github.com/meeshkan/mutation-observer-applier),
but I really wanted it to be composed into a single javascript file, that could be simply included as a
module in HTML, rather than precompiled and bundled and all that jazz.

I had started to write this on my own, and then I encountered Meeshkan's code. I've changed the licensing to MIT to
reflect that fact.
